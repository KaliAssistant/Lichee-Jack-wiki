# Environment Setup

This section describes the recommended host environment and basic tools required to work with **Lichee-Jack**.

---

## 1. Host System

A **UNIX-like operating system** is strongly recommended.

### Recommended OS

* **Debian** (stable or testing)
* **Kali Linux**
* **Ubuntu**

### Architecture

* **x86_64 only**

The official host toolchain is:

```text
riscv64-musl-gxx-x86_64
```

Other architectures are **not supported**.

> [!WARNING]
>
> ### Windows Users ⚠️
>
> If you are using **Microsoft Windows**, you **must** run Linux via one of the following:
>
> * Virtual Machine (VM)
> * Docker / Podman
> * Kubernetes environment
>
> Native Windows builds are **not supported**.

---

## 2. SFTP / File Browser

You will need an SFTP-capable file manager to interact with the device filesystem.

### Linux

Most Linux desktop environments already include SFTP support via **GVFS**.

Examples:

* **Thunar** (recommended)
* Nautilus
* Dolphin

You can also use the terminal:

```bash
sftp user@device_ip
```

### Windows / macOS

You may need a third-party client, such as:

* **FileZilla**
* Any FTP/SFTP-capable file manager

The CLI `sftp` command is also supported if available.

---

## 3. USB OTG (USB Gadget Mode)

Lichee-Jack (and similar devices) support **Linux USB Gadget** mode and can present themselves as:

* CDC-ECM
* CDC-NCM
* CDC-EEM
* RNDIS

### Windows

* **Windows 10** and **Windows 11 < 22H2**

  * The device does **not auto-probe correctly**
  * Manual driver binding is required via **Device Manager**

* **Windows 11 (22H2 and later)**

  * Works out of the box
  * Microsoft finally fixed this behavior

### Linux

* Works out of the box
* Drivers are **built into the kernel**
* Works even with **custom VID / PID**

No additional configuration is required.

### macOS

* Should work correctly on **macOS 15 or later**
* Earlier versions may have limited support depending on gadget mode

---

> [!NOTE]
>
> USB gadget functions are implemented using **ConfigFS**
> No legacy `echo > /sys/kernel/...` hacks are used
> Configuration is declarative and reproducible

---

> [!TIP]
>
> If you encounter issues:
> 
> * Check kernel logs (`dmesg`)
> * Verify USB gadget configuration
> * Confirm host OS compatibility
