# Initial Configuration

This section covers the **first boot**, **initial SSH access**, **basic security hardening**, and **network setup** for Lichee-Jack.

---

## First Boot & SSH Login

On the **first power-on**, make sure the **mode switch is set to `mode 0 (debug)`**.

Lichee-Jack exposes a **USB CDC-NCM** network interface to the host.

Default credentials:

* **root**
  password: `toor`
* **debian**
  password: `licheejack`

### Connect via USB (CDC-NCM)

After plugging in the USB cable, your host should receive an IP automatically.

```bash
ssh root@10.42.0.1
```

(Optional) Copy your SSH public key:

```bash
ssh-copy-id root@10.42.0.1
```

> **Recommended:** Always use SSH keys instead of password authentication.

---

## Change Default Passwords (Strongly Recommended)

Leaving default credentials is a **critical security risk**.

### Change root password

```bash
passwd
```

### Change `debian` user password

```bash
su debian
passwd
```

### Non-interactive method (for automation)

```bash
echo "debian:NEW_PASSWORD" | chpasswd
```

---

## Wi-Fi Setup (Optional)

Lichee-Jack uses **NetworkManager**.

### TUI (recommended)

```bash
nmtui
```

* Select **Activate a connection**
* Create or edit a Wi-Fi profile
* Connect and verify

### CLI (manual)

```bash
nmcli device wifi list
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID_NAME" password "WIFI_PASSWORD"
```

Check status:

```bash
nmcli device status
```

---

## System Update (⚠️ Read Carefully)

Update package lists:

```bash
apt update
```

Check available upgrades:

```bash
apt list --upgradable -a
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> ⚠️ **Kernel & Bootloader Warning**
> Do **NOT** upgrade the following packages:
>
> * `initramfs*`
> * `linux-image-*`
> * `linux-headers-*` (Debian official `riscv64` builds)
>
> Lichee-Jack boots **only** with the project-specific **U-Boot** and **linux-licheejack** kernel.
> Blindly running `apt upgrade -y` may brick the device.

### Safe Upgrade Method

Manually upgrade **userland packages only**:

```bash
apt upgrade PACKAGE_NAME
```

Or explicitly hold kernel-related packages:

```bash
apt-mark hold linux-image-* linux-headers-* initramfs*
```
