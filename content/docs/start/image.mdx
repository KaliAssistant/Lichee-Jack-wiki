# Flash Image

This guide explains how to prepare an SD card and flash the **Lichee-Jack** system image.

---

## 1. Prepare an SD Card

Lichee-Jack boots **only from an SD card**. It does **not** use on-board SPI flash or eMMC. This makes the system easy to wipe, reflash, and recover.

### SD Card Requirements

* Interface: **SD / SDHC**
* Speed class: **Class 10** (minimum write speed 10 MB/s)
* Capacity: **16–32 GB** is sufficient

> [!NOTE]
>
> The main PCB (LicheeRV-Nano board) configures SDIO with a **maximum stable frequency of 25 MHz** in the device tree. Although 50 MHz may appear to work, it often causes instability or card detection failures.

### Recommended Cards

High-end or expensive cards are unnecessary.

* ✅ SanDisk **Ultra** / **Ultra A1**
* ❌ Extreme / A2 cards (no real benefit here)

**Recommended example:**

* SanDisk Ultra 32GB Class 10 SDHC I

## 2. Download the Prebuilt Image

1. Go to the GitHub releases page:

   [KaliAssistant/Lichee-Jack/releases](https://github.com/KaliAssistant/Lichee-Jack/releases/latest)

2. Download the following files:

   * The **latest system image**: `licheervnano_sd.img.xz`
   * The corresponding **checksum file**: `licheervnano_sd.img.sha256sum`

3. Decompress the image:

   ```bash
   xz -d licheervnano_sd.img.xz
   ```

   This will produce `licheervnano_sd.img` in the same directory.

4. Verify the image checksum (**important!**):

   ```bash
   sha256sum -c licheervnano_sd.img.sha256sum
   ```

   You should see an output similar to:

   ```text
   licheervnano_sd.img: OK
   ```

   If the check fails, **do not flash the image**. Re-download both files and verify again.


> [!WARNING]
>
> Do **not** skip checksum verification. A corrupted image can lead to boot failures or undefined behavior.

## 3. Flash the Image

### Linux

Use `dd` (simple and reliable):

```bash
sudo dd if=/path/to/licheervnano_sd.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Double-check the target device (`/dev/sdX`).
> Selecting the wrong device **will erase your system disk**.

After flashing, it is recommended to run:

```bash
sync
```

Then safely remove the SD card.

## 4. Boot the Device

1. Insert the SD card into the **Lichee-Jack**
2. Connect the device to your computer using a **USB cable**
3. Set the **mode switch** to **mode0 (debug mode)**
4. Power on / plug in the device

The system will:

* Boot automatically from the SD card
* **Automatically resize the rootfs partition** on first boot
* Enter **debug mode**

  * Blue fading RGB LED
  * USB gadget enumerates as **CDC / NCM** network device

After boot completes:

* Your host will receive an IP address via DHCP
* Lichee-Jack default address:

```
10.42.0.1
```

You can now access the device through the USB network interface.
