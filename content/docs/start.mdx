# Getting Started

## Hardware

> [!NOTE]
>
> This guide assumes you already have a Lichee-Jack device, either built by yourself or obtained elsewhere.  
> If you don’t have one yet, follow the [**Hardware Guide**](/docs/hardware) to build your own.

**Lichee-Jack** is a fully open-source hardware and software project.  
It is **not commercially available** at this time, but all schematics, PCB designs, and source code are published on GitHub, allowing anyone to build their own device.  
A finished product may be released in the future.
