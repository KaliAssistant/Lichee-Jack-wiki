# Basic

This section contains **foundational payload building blocks** for Lichee-Jack.

The **Basic** category focuses on small, composable primitives that are commonly used by more advanced payloads. These examples are intentionally minimal, script-friendly, and designed to work reliably in constrained environments.

Typical goals of Basic payloads:

* Provide **visual or audio feedback**
* Validate hardware functionality
* Serve as **building blocks** for larger attack chains
* Demonstrate correct usage patterns for core utilities

## LED

LED payloads provide **immediate visual feedback** using the onboard RGB LED.

They are commonly used to:

* Indicate device state (booting, armed, running, error)
* Signal payload progress or success
* Run background animations during long-running tasks

The LED interface is **exclusive**: starting a new LED or `shmled` instance will terminate the previous one, ensuring deterministic behavior.

## Audio

Audio payloads demonstrate how to interact with the onboard **microphone and speaker** using standard ALSA tools combined with `AUDIOCTL`.

They can be used to:

* Capture environmental audio
* Provide audible feedback
* Implement live monitoring or recording payloads

Audio examples emphasize **simple shell pipelines** that integrate cleanly with LED indicators and payload logic.

## LOOT_DIR

LOOT_DIR payloads demonstrate how to work with **directories, files, and loot storage** on Lichee-Jack in a safe and repeatable way.

They are commonly used to:

* Create and manage loot directories
* Store payload output and captured data
* Organize results by payload or execution time
* Support later analysis or exfiltration workflows

LOOT_DIR examples focus on **simple shell patterns** for directory creation, naming, and counting, ensuring payloads never overwrite existing data and remain easy to audit.

## NETMODE

NETMODE payloads demonstrate how to **dynamically control network behavior** on Lichee-Jack by switching the operating mode of the primary Ethernet interface.

They are commonly used to:

* Bring interfaces up safely before network actions
* Act as a DHCP client on existing networks
* Act as a DHCP server for isolated or rogue setups
* Automatically select the appropriate network role
* Apply static or custom NetworkManager configurations

NETMODE examples emphasize **pre-flight checks**, deterministic mode switching, and clean integration with payload logic, LEDs, and follow-up actions.
