# Recon

This section documents **reconnaissance payloads** for Lichee-Jack.

Recon payloads focus on **network discovery, topology mapping, and information gathering** once the device is connected to a target network. They are usually executed after link-up and DHCP acquisition, and commonly combine:

* Network interface control (`NETMODE`, `end0`)
* Active scanning tools (e.g. `nmap`)
* Passive discovery (LLDP, routing info)
* Loot collection and optional exfiltration
* LED status feedback for each stage

> [!WARNING]
>
> Recon payloads can generate significant network traffic. Use only on networks you are authorized to test.

## Nmap

Network discovery and port-scanning payloads based on **nmap**.
Used for fast host detection, service enumeration, and basic OS fingerprinting
after Lichee-Jack is plugged into a target network.
