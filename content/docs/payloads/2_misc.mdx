# Misc

This section contains **miscellaneous and experimental payloads** for Lichee-Jack.

Unlike *Basic* payloads, items in **Misc** are usually:

* Higher-level or more opinionated
* Built by composing multiple primitives (LED, Audio, USB, Network)
* Demonstration-oriented, fun, or situational
* Not always required for core operation

These payloads are still fully functional, but are primarily intended as **examples, references, or inspiration** for custom payload development.

## Music Player

The Music Player payload demonstrates how Lichee-Jack can be used as a **standalone audio playback device**.

It typically combines:

* `AUDIOCTL` for speaker control
* SoX playback tools
* Optional LED indicators for playback state
* Simple playlist or file-based audio selection

This payload is useful for:

* Verifying audio output hardware
* Demo or prank-style payloads
* Learning how to integrate audio control into longer-running payload logic

>  Misc payloads are a good place to prototype ideas before promoting them into **Basic** or **Advanced** categories.
