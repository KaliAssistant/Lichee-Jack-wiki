# Hardware

This section documents the **hardware design** of the Lichee-Jack project. All designs are **open-source**, reproducible, and intended for makers, researchers, and security professionals who want to build or modify the device themselves.

You can explore the hardware in the following categories:

---

## PCB & FPC

Mainboard schematics, PCB layout, FPC designs, power domains, signal routing notes, and manufacturing considerations.

## 3D Print Cases

3D printable enclosure designs, STL sources, print settings, material recommendations, and assembly instructions.

## Design Philosophy

* **Open-source hardware (OSHW)** – all design files are provided
* **Modular** – core board + extension modules
* **Hackable by design** – exposed test pads, headers, and debug interfaces
* **Linux-first** – optimized for embedded Linux workflows

## Toolchains & Formats

* PCB: KiCad
* Mechanical: STEP / STL
* Manufacturing: Gerber, drill, pick-and-place

> [!NOTE]
>
> Hardware revisions may change over time. Always check the revision tag that matches your board before manufacturing or assembling.

If you are new to the project, it is recommended to start with **PCB & FPC** to understand the system architecture, then move on to the **3D printed case** and **extension modules**.
