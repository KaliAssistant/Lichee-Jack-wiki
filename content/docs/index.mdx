# Introduction

**Lichee-Jack** is a low-cost, DIY **social-engineering LAN Attack & Penetration Testing Army knife** inspired by the **Hak5 SharkJack**.
It is designed for **payload delivery**, **opportunistic wired auditing**, and **red-team / SE engagements** in environments where localnet is accessible.

Lichee-Jack combines **USB gadget functionality**, **on-board Ethernet**, and **hardware mode selection** into a compact, fully open-source platform.

> 100% open-source hardware & software
> Built for hackers, auditors, and embedded developers

## How it works

Lichee-Jack is designed to operate as a **plug-and-execute** LAN implant with minimal user interaction.

### 1. Power & deployment

The device can be powered via:
- USB (host or charger)
- Internal Li-Po battery

Once powered, it boots directly from the SD card into a minimal Debian Linux environment.

---

### 2. Mode selection (hardware switch)

A physical **SP3T mode-switch** selects the operating mode **before boot**:

| Mode | Purpose |
|-----:|--------|
| 0 | Debug / development mode |
| 1 | Payload 1 execution |
| 2 | Payload 2 execution |

The selected mode determines:
- Which payloads are executed
- Which USB gadget functions are exposed
- LED behavior and system services

---

### 3. Payload execution

Payloads are **shell-based** and executed automatically after boot.

Typical payload actions include:
- Network reconnaissance (ARP, DHCP, SNMP, mDNS)
- Traffic redirection or MITM setup
- Data exfiltration over USB or Ethernet
- LED / audio feedback for execution state

Payload logic is **transparent and modifiable** — no obfuscation, no closed binaries.

---

### 4. Visual & physical feedback

- **RJ45 RGB LED**
  - Boot status
  - Link state
  - Payload activity
  - Error conditions
- Optional **audio cues** via onboard speaker

This allows the operator to understand the device state **without connecting a terminal**.

---

### 5. Access & control

Depending on configuration, Lichee-Jack can expose:
- USB Ethernet (CDC-ECM / RNDIS)
- USB serial console
- SSH over USB or LAN

All services are controlled via init scripts and build-time configuration.
