# Software

This section documents the **software architecture, build system, and core runtime features** of **Lichee-Jack**.
It is intended for developers, researchers, and advanced users who want to **understand, customize, or extend** the system.

You can explore how the operating system is structured, how firmware images are built from source, and how Lichee-Jack exposes its core capabilities through scripts, services, and utilities.

---

## System

Lichee-Jack runs on **Debian GNU/Linux**, customized for embedded usage on the LicheeRV Nano platform.

This section covers:

* Linux distribution layout and filesystem structure
* Init system and boot flow
* Hardware abstraction and device drivers
* Default services and security considerations

## Build Image

Lichee-Jack images are **built from source**, allowing full control over the kernel, root filesystem, and included tools.

This section covers:

* Toolchains and build environment setup
* Kernel configuration and module selection
* Root filesystem customization
* Image generation, flashing, and upgrade workflow

This is recommended for users who want to:

* Enable or disable kernel features
* Add custom tools or payloads
* Optimize image size or boot speed

## Utilities

Utilities are the **runtime components** that make Lichee-Jack behave like a modular attack / automation platform.

This section covers:

* System scripts and boot-time logic
* Init / service units
* Mode switch handling and payload dispatch
* Built-in utilities and helper tools

These components allow Lichee-Jack to:

* React to hardware state changes
* Switch behavior using the mode selector
* Execute user-defined payloads reliably

## Who should read this section?

* Embedded Linux developers
* Red Team / Blue Team / Security researchers
* Payload authors and automation users
* Anyone who wants full control over Lichee-Jack

This documentation assumes basic familiarity with Linux and embedded systems.
