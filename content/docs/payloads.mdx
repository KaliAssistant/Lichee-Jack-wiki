# Payloads

This section documents **how to learn, build, and develop payloads** for **Lichee-Jack**.

Payloads are small, task-focused scripts or bundles that define what Lichee-Jack does when plugged into a target system or network. They can control USB gadget roles, run network tools, automate attacks, or simply perform diagnostics and demos.

You can find real-world examples, templates, and helper functions in the official payload repository:

## What is a Payload?

A payload typically consists of:

* A **main entry script** (usually shell-based)
* Optional helper scripts or binaries
* Configuration files (if needed)
* LED / status feedback logic

Payloads are executed by **jackstart** depending on:

* Hardware switch position
* USB gadget mode
* Boot or plug-in events

This design keeps payloads **simple, auditable, and hackable**.

---

## Basic

Basic payloads demonstrate the **core capabilities** of Lichee-Jack.

These examples are ideal for:

* First-time users
* Understanding payload structure
* Learning how USB gadget modes work

Typical examples include:

* USB Ethernet bring-up
* Simple HID injection
* LED status control
* File drop or log collection

## Misc

Misc payloads are **experimental, demo, or testing-focused**.

They may not be optimized for real-world use, but are extremely useful for:

* Prototyping new ideas
* Hardware validation
* Debugging USB or network behavior
* Demonstrating features

Examples may include:

* Stress tests
* Debug USB gadgets
* Temporary proof-of-concept scripts

## Recon

Recon payloads focus on **network discovery and intelligence gathering**.

These payloads are designed to run automatically when Lichee-Jack is connected to a network, making them useful for:

* Passive reconnaissance
* Network mapping
* Target identification

Common techniques include:

* ARP scanning
* Service enumeration
* Packet sniffing
* DNS / DHCP observation

## Advanced (Coming Soon)

Future documentation will cover more advanced payload topics, such as:

* Multi-stage payloads
* Conditional execution logic
* Payload chaining
* Persistence techniques
* Custom binaries and cross-compilation

These sections will be added as the ecosystem evolves.

---

## Notes

* All payloads are **open-source** and community-driven
* Read the source before running any payload
* **Only use Lichee-Jack on networks and systems you own or are authorized to test**

If you want to contribute payloads, improvements, or documentation, pull requests are always welcome.
