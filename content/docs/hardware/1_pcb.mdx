## Hardware System Overview

The complete Lichee-Jack hardware stack consists of **three primary boards**, designed to work together as a compact and extensible system around the **LicheeRV Nano**.

## 1. Lichee-Jack_EXT_BOARD

<br/>

<br/>
<Img src="/assets/ext_board_v1_2_top.png" />

The **EXT_BOARD** is the main functional extension PCB. It provides power management, peripherals, and system control.

**Key features:**

* Battery management system (Li-Po)
* WS2812 RGB status LED
* SP3T hardware control switch
* Ethernet signal breakout pads
* Peripheral support circuitry

**Mechanical specifications:**

* PCB thickness: **1.6 mm**
* Standard FR-4

> [!NOTE]
>
> This board is the only PCB suitable for **full PCBA assembly** by manufacturers.

## 2. Lichee-Jack_EXT_BOARD_FPC

<br/>

The **EXT_BOARD_FPC** is a flexible interconnect used to bridge signals between the LicheeRV Nano, EXT_BOARD, and HEADER_BOARD.

**Responsibilities:**

* ETH pads: LicheeRV Nano → EXT_BOARD
* CSI pads: LicheeRV Nano → HEADER_BOARD
* Additional GPIO and expansion signals

**Notes:**

* Designed for manual soldering
* Enables compact stacking and enclosure compatibility

## 3. Lichee-Jack_HEADER_BOARD

<br/>
<Img src="/assets/header-board-freecad.png" />

The **HEADER_BOARD** acts as an adapter and signal breakout layer for external extension modules.

**Functions:**

* Converts FPC signals to a **1.27 mm 2×10 SMT header**
* Provides mechanical stability for stacked modules
* Interface for custom extension boards

**Mechanical specifications:**

* PCB thickness: **0.8 mm**

## Assembly Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Always follow the recommended soldering temperatures to prevent PCB or component damage.

### EXT_BOARD

* Use **high-temperature solder paste**

  * Sn63/Pb37 or SAC305

### EXT_BOARD_FPC

* Hand-solder using a **standard soldering iron**

### HEADER_BOARD

* Use **high-temperature solder paste**

### LicheeRV Nano + EXT_BOARD

* Use **low-temperature solder paste**

  * Sn42/Bi58 (recommended)

## Battery Specification

* Type: **Li-Po 3.7 V**
* Capacity: **200 mAh**
* Model: **402030**

This battery size is verified to fit the official **3D-printed enclosure**.

---

## 5V Power Safety Notes

The LicheeRV Nano connects **VBUS ↔ VSYS** via a factory-installed **0Ω resistor** (marked `5V`).

> [!WARNING]
>
> When supplying **external 5V power**, you **must remove** this 0Ω resistor to avoid back-powering and damage.

---

## Enclosure Compatibility Assembly Guide

To assemble the system so it fits inside the 3D-printed case:

### Step 1. Remove CSI Connector

* Desolder the CSI camera connector from the LicheeRV Nano

### Step 2. Install HEADER_BOARD

* Populate SMT connectors according to the BOM

### Step 3. Connect EXT_BOARD_FPC

* Solder the FPC between:

  * LicheeRV Nano
  * HEADER_BOARD
  * EXT_BOARD

### Step 4. Ethernet Wiring

* Use a short **4P or 8P** Ethernet cable
* Solder to EXT_BOARD ETH pads:

  * WOG, OG, WG, G → RJ45 pins **1, 2, 3, 6**
* Crimp an **8P8C** connector on the cable end

## PCB Manufacturing & PCBA

You may submit the **EXT_BOARD** for assembly using:

* Gerber files
* BOM
* CPL

Supported manufacturers include:

* JLCPCB
* PCBWay
* Seeed Studio

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Only the **EXT_BOARD** can be assembled automatically. The LicheeRV Nano and FPC connections require manual work unless custom services are arranged.
the manufacturer will only assemble the extension board (EXT_BOARD). The SIPEED LicheeRV Nano module itself is not included in the PCBA service — you must solder the LicheeRV Nano to the EXT_BOARD yourself after receiving the assembled PCBs, unless you explicitly arrange a custom assembly that includes the Nano (rare and often expensive).
>
> If you want a fully populated, plug-and-play unit, contact the PCBA vendor beforehand and confirm which parts they will source and assemble (and whether they can handle the LicheeRV Nano module). Otherwise expect to receive the EXT_BOARD fully assembled and still needing the LicheeRV Nano and a few user-installed parts.
