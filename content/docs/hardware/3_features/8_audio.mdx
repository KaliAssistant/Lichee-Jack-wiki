# Audio System

Lichee-Jack integrates a compact audio subsystem suitable for voice prompts, alerts, and basic audio playback/recording.

* **Speaker**: 10 × 10 mm round, **1 W**, 8 Ω
* **Microphone**: Onboard **16‑bit digital MEMS microphone** (on LicheeRV Nano)
* **Audio Codec (ADAC)**: `cv181x-adac`
* **Power Amplifier**: **AW8010AFCR** (onboard)

## Speaker & Amplifier

The onboard amplifier **AW8010AFCR** drives the internal speaker directly.

Typical characteristics:

* Supply voltage: **5 V**
* Output power: **≈ 1 W @ 8 Ω**
* Test condition: `VDD = 5 V, RL = 8 Ω, f = 1 kHz`
* Efficiency: **≈ 90%**

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Volume warning**
>
> Lichee-Jack uses a **1 W speaker**. During testing, **100% playback volume** is intended for **2 W speakers**.
>
> **Do NOT set playback volume above 80%**, otherwise long‑term use may:
>
> * Cause audible distortion
> * Damage the speaker
> * Overheat the PA

## Microphone

The LicheeRV Nano includes an onboard **SMD MEMS microphone**:

* Model: **LMA2718T421‑OA5‑2**
* Sensitivity: **−42 dB**
* Signal‑to‑Noise Ratio (SNR): **55 dB**

> [!NOTE]
>
> When the capture volume is set to **maximum (24)**, recording quality degrades significantly (clipping + noise).
>
> Recommended capture volume: **20**

## ALSA Control

Audio input/output levels are controlled via **ALSA**.

### Microphone (ADC)

```sh
amixer -D hw:0 cset name='ADC Capture Volume' <0-24>
```

* Range: `0 – 24`
* Recommended: `20`

### Speaker (DAC)

```sh
amixer -D hw:1 cset name='DAC Playback Volume' <0-32>
```

* Range: `0 – 32`
* Recommended max: **≤ 80% (~25)**

## Practical Recommendations

* Keep playback volume **≤ 80%** for daily use
* Avoid maximum ADC gain when recording
* For voice prompts or system sounds, moderate volume provides the best clarity
* If external speakers are required, use an **external amplified speaker** instead of pushing the onboard PA

## Summary

The Lichee-Jack audio system is optimized for **low‑power, embedded audio use cases**:

* Clean voice output
* Basic audio feedback
* Acceptable voice recording quality

Proper volume configuration is essential to maintain audio quality and hardware reliability.
