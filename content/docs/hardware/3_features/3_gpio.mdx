Lichee-Jack replaces the original **LicheeRV-Nano CSI FFC connector** with a **1.27 mm dual-row 2×10 SMT header**, providing a compact and flexible GPIO expansion interface for external modules.

This design turns the CSI pad area into a general-purpose extension port while maintaining good signal integrity and mechanical reliability.

## Header FPC & Header Board (Legacy Design)

In early hardware revisions, the GPIO expansion was implemented using a **Header-FPC + Header-Board** architecture:

* A **custom FPC** was designed to solder directly onto the CSI pads of the LicheeRV-Nano
* The FPC connects to a small **header board**
* The header board is **0.8 mm thick**, with:

  * **Top side**: 1.27 mm 2×10 SMT header
  * **Bottom side**: FPC solder pads

This approach enabled early prototyping and validation of the 20-pin GPIO concept, but introduced additional connectors and assembly steps.

## Extension Board FPC (Latest Design)

In the latest hardware revision, the original **ETH-FPC** and **Header-FPC** were consolidated into a single **Extension Board FPC**.

This new architecture:

* Replaces multiple FPC cables with **one unified FPC**
* Carries GPIO, Ethernet, and extension signals together
* Directly interfaces with the Extension Board

### Benefits

* Simplified inter-board connections
* Reduced connector count
* Improved mechanical stability
* Better manufacturability and assembly reliability

This change significantly improves robustness while reducing BOM complexity.

> Signal availability and multiplexing depend on SoC pinmux configuration. Refer to the software documentation for GPIO / SPI / I2C  usage details.
