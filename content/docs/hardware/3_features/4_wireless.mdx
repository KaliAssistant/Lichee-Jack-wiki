# WiFi6 / BT5.2

Lichee-Jack supports **WiFi 6** and **Bluetooth 5.2** via the **AIC8800** module used on the **LicheeRV-Nano W**.

The Wi‑Fi interface uses **SDIO**, while Bluetooth (BLE) uses a **UART over USB** transport.

---

## WiFi driver

Lichee-Jack uses a **patched AIC8800 driver** based on the source from `radxa-pkg/aic8800`.

In the original driver `Makefile`, monitor mode and frame injection are disabled by default via the following macros:

```makefile showLineNumbers
# Enable Monitor+Data interface support (need FW support)
CONFIG_RWNX_MON_DATA = n
CONFIG_RWNX_MON_XMIT = n
CONFIG_RWNX_MON_RXFILTER = n
```

To enable **active monitor mode (frame injection)**, modify them as follows:

```makefile showLineNumbers
# Enable Monitor+Data interface support (need FW support)
CONFIG_RWNX_MON_DATA = y
CONFIG_RWNX_MON_XMIT = y
CONFIG_RWNX_MON_RXFILTER = n
```

> [!IMPORTANT] 
>
> `CONFIG_RWNX_MON_RXFILTER` must remain **disabled**. Enabling it will cause the kernel to fail capturing packets correctly.

With the above configuration, Lichee-Jack can reliably operate in monitor mode while retaining normal data interfaces.

## Bluetooth (BLE)

On the **LicheeRV-Nano W PCB**, Bluetooth is gated by a footprint for an **RN4-4020 (0Ω) resistor**.

* If you purchase a standard LicheeRV-Nano W, simply install this **0Ω resistor** to enable BLE hardware routing.
* No additional PCB modification is required.

### Transport details

* **WiFi**: SDIO (dedicated to WiFi 6)
* **Bluetooth / BLE**: USB UART (RX / TX / CTS / RTS)

Bluetooth is **not** routed over SDIO because:

* SDIO is already occupied by WiFi
* Running BLE over SDIO on AIC8800 is **unstable**
* UART-based transport provides significantly better stability and reliability

For this reason, Lichee-Jack uses **USB UART** for BLE exclusively.

This design ensures stable WiFi 6 operation, functional monitor mode with frame injection, and reliable Bluetooth 5.2 support without SDIO contention.
