## Design Philosophy

Lichee‑Jack is designed as a **hardware-assisted LAN implant** focused on:

* Rapid deployment
* Visual and physical feedback
* Payload-driven workflows
* Fully open-source hardware and software

Every feature is intentionally exposed to the user, avoiding vendor lock-in, proprietary tooling, or closed firmware.

## Payload-Oriented Hardware

The hardware design directly supports payload execution:

* LEDs for state indication and progress feedback
* Mode switch for zero-interaction execution
* Ethernet + USB gadgets for multi-vector access
* Battery-backed operation for covert deployment

This makes Lichee‑Jack ideal for **Red Team**, **Social Engineering**, **Education**, and **Research** use cases.
