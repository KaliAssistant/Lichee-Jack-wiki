# Utilities

This section documents **Lichee-Jack core utilities**, including their purpose, behavior, and typical usage patterns.
All utility source code is hosted on GitHub:

* **Repository**: `github.com/KaliAssistant/Lichee-Jack-utils`

These tools are designed to be:

* Lightweight (shell / small native helpers)
* Scriptable (payload-friendly)
* Safe for embedded usage
* Closely integrated with Lichee-Jack hardware features
